Released in the 1970s, the C language became the foundation for countless software innovations. Its powerful syntax, combined with direct memory control, made it the preferred choice for developing operating systems like Unix. Over the decades, C evolved, influencing the creation of many other languages like C++, Java, and C#. Though rooted in low-level systems programming, C remains one of the most widely used languages in the world today.
